### Understanding Sugar Addiction

Sugar consumption triggers dopamine release in the brain’s reward centers, creating addictive patterns similar to those seen with other substances. Research shows that sugar can lead to hormonal imbalances, energy fluctuations, and persistent cravings through neurological pathways.
