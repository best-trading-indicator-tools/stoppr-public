1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,132
Hey, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,382 --> 00:00:03,682
Happy to meet you.

3
00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:05,186
You're still going.

4
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:06,590
That says a lot.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,341
This isn't easy work, but you're
showing up.

6
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:10,698
That matters.

7
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:13,270
I'm Cassandra, you coach for today.

8
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,346
And today's Stoppr lesson is
a real-life one.

9
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:18,307
One you've probably lived through.

10
00:00:18,557 --> 00:00:20,322
Let's talk about peer pressure.

11
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,447
And sugar.

12
00:00:21,836 --> 00:00:22,858
You're at a dinner.

13
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,494
Maybe it's friends.

14
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:25,898
Maybe family.

15
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:29,159
The meal is done, and then—here
it comes.

16
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:30,570
A giant dessert.

17
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:30,570
A giant dessert.

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,299
Placed right in the middle.

19
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,796
Everyone smiles.

20
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,036
Everyone says, "Just have a little!"

21
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,818
And now it's awkward.

22
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,833
You didn't want sugar tonight.

23
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,423
You promised yourself.

24
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:43,245
But now it's in front of you.

25
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:45,438
And so are the people you care
about.

26
00:00:45,688 --> 00:00:47,824
Saying no suddenly feels rude.

27
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:48,857
Or weird.

28
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:51,282
Or like you're the one making
a fuss.

29
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:53,808
This is one of the hardest moments.

30
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:57,023
Not because you don't have the
willpower—but because you don't

31
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,555
want to disappoint anyone.

32
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:00,191
You don't want to explain.

33
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:00,191
You don't want to explain.

34
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,060
You don't want to stand out.

35
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,817
Sugar in these moments isn't about
taste.

36
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,407
It's about fitting in.

37
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:07,632
You eat it.

38
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:11,544
Not because you want to—but because
it's easier than saying no.

39
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:14,534
And after, maybe you feel a little
off.

40
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:15,659
Physically.

41
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,738
Emotionally.

42
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:18,885
Like you broke your own promise.

43
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:22,478
But here's the truth: these moments
will happen.

44
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:24,207
And they don't make you weak.

45
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:25,897
They make you human.

46
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:28,190
The first step is noticing it.

47
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,316
Naming it.

48
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,323
This isn't just about sugar.

49
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,323
This isn't just about sugar.

50
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,238
It's about social pressure.

51
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:34,456
That's real.

52
00:01:34,606 --> 00:01:35,813
That's powerful.

53
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,200
You can't always control the room.

54
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,486
But you can control your awareness.

55
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:44,126
And over time, with practice,
you'll find your words.

56
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:46,505
Your little ways to stay true
to you.

57
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,402
Even when dessert is staring you
in the face.

58
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:50,813
You've got this.

59
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,642
See you in the next lesson.
