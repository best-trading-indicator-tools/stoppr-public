1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,389
Hey there.

2
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:02,754
Happy to meet you.

3
00:00:03,225 --> 00:00:04,211
You're showing up.

4
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,380
That's not easy—and it means
you're serious about real change.

5
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,498
My name is Alexandra, I'll be
your teacher for today's Stoppr

6
00:00:10,498 --> 00:00:11,113
lesson.

7
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:13,906
Today, let's talk about something
that doesn't get enough credit

8
00:00:13,906 --> 00:00:15,171
when it comes to sugar.

9
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,210
Sport.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,707
Doing exercise.

11
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:18,693
Moving.

12
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:19,632
Running.

13
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:21,129
Any sport really.

14
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:22,354
Or even just...

15
00:00:22,504 --> 00:00:23,665
moving your body.

16
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:26,841
You might not think of exercise
when you think of sugar cravings.

17
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,198
But it matters.

18
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:29,742
More than you'd expect.

19
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,081
Because cravings aren't just about
food.

20
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,081
Because cravings aren't just about
food.

21
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:33,532
They're about your brain.

22
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:34,750
Your energy.

23
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,782
Your mood.

24
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:39,910
When you move—walk, dance, stretch,
lift, run—your body does something

25
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,769
amazing.

26
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:42,173
It makes you feel good.

27
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:43,205
Naturally.

28
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,266
You get dopamine, endorphins.

29
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,995
Chemicals that lift you up.

30
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:48,306
That calm you down.

31
00:00:48,456 --> 00:00:51,011
That balance out the stuff sugar
usually fakes.

32
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,329
And guess what?

33
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:55,323
When your brain already feels
good, it doesn't go looking for

34
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:55,915
sugar.

35
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:57,930
Movement helps clear the fog.

36
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,334
Shake off stress.

37
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,691
Release tension.

38
00:00:59,484 --> 00:01:00,691
Release tension.

39
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:01,956
It resets you.

40
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,772
And when you move often, your
body starts asking for better

41
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:05,364
fuel.

42
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,139
You don't crave the same junk.

43
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:09,681
You want food that keeps you
going, not food that slows you

44
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:10,215
down.

45
00:01:10,465 --> 00:01:12,926
Even a short walk can flip a switch
in your day.

46
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:15,080
The point isn't to burn calories.

47
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,670
It's to break the pattern.

48
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,049
To show your body a different
way to feel better.

49
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:20,924
You don't have to be an athlete.

50
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,421
You just have to move.

51
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:24,011
Every day if you can.

52
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:27,628
This one thing—this small shift—can
change your whole journey with

53
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:28,208
sugar.

54
00:01:28,458 --> 00:01:29,387
So try it.

55
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,209
Not for weight, not for goals.

56
00:01:29,537 --> 00:01:31,209
Not for weight, not for goals.

57
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,031
Just for how it makes you feel.

58
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,720
See you in the next lesson.

59
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,271
I am, Proud of you.
