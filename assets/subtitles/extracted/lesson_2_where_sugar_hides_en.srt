00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,435
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,257
This is your first Stoppr lesson

3
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:05,783
We are covering an important topic
today.

4
00:00:05,933 --> 00:00:07,326
Where is sugar hiding.

5
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:08,644
My name is Emma.

6
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:09,909
Let's get started!

7
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:11,505
Here's a funny story.

8
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,774
Sugar actually sneaks into foods
you would never expect.

9
00:00:15,024 --> 00:00:16,975
The goal is to identify those
foods.

10
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,617
When you will know about those,
you can reduce the amount you

11
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:20,568
eat every day.

12
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:23,419
Or, you can replace them completely
with something else.

13
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:26,525
Your main mission is to get to
a weekly mix that is good for

14
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:29,056
your body, and for your everyday
energy.

15
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,071
Let's discover this, together.

16
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,071
Let's discover this, together.

17
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:32,156
Number 1.

18
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,939
Sauces and dressings.

19
00:00:34,089 --> 00:00:37,386
Things like ketchup, barbecue
sauce, salad dressings.

20
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:39,487
Even the sauce you add to your
pasta.

21
00:00:39,637 --> 00:00:41,773
It's basically all the industrial
foods.

22
00:00:42,423 --> 00:00:44,699
They all have sugar added, to
taste better.

23
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:46,195
But it's not good for you.

24
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,156
It get's you tired, and addicted.

25
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:49,421
Like a bad drug.

26
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:53,537
Always check the label, at the
back of any industrial product,

27
00:00:53,537 --> 00:00:56,265
to see the quantity of sugar it
contains.

28
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,720
Check the Carbo-hydrates line,
it's the sugar line basically.

29
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,662
For foods, if there's more than
5% of Carbo-hydrates, it's too

30
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,662
For foods, if there's more than
5% of Carbo-hydrates, it's too

31
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:04,289
much.

32
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:08,231
For drinks, if it's more than
3% of Carbo-hydrates, it's too

33
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:08,858
much.

34
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,358
You will see that a lot of the
industrial food has a lot of sugar.

35
00:01:12,508 --> 00:01:13,577
But that's ok.

36
00:01:13,727 --> 00:01:15,027
In a future lesson.

37
00:01:15,177 --> 00:01:18,196
We will discover other foods,
that taste the same, but don't

38
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:19,403
have as much sugar.

39
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:23,071
Now let's see the groups of foods
that can really hide sugar.

40
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:24,650
Dairy products.

41
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,290
Flavored yogurts, chocolate milk,
and creamy desserts often have

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,219
lots of sugar.

43
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,829
To cut down, try plain yogurt
or milk and add fresh fruit for

44
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,829
To cut down, try plain yogurt
or milk and add fresh fruit for

45
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,595
sweetness.

46
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,774
Another group.

47
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:35,574
Bread.

48
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:39,532
Bread that say "healthy" or "whole
grain" can still have lots of

49
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,136
sugar.

50
00:01:40,286 --> 00:01:43,792
Try to cut down on eating bread,
as much as possible, even if it

51
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:44,884
seems low sugar.

52
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:45,969
Another one.

53
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,102
Pasta.

54
00:01:47,252 --> 00:01:49,481
Pasta itself contains hidden
sugar.

55
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:53,393
It's sometimes added during production
to improve the texture, the taste.

56
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:55,725
Even plain pasta might contain
sugar.

57
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,033
Check the label to choose pasta
without added sugars.

58
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,469
But really, try to reduce your
consumption of any pasta - it's

59
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:02,469
But really, try to reduce your
consumption of any pasta - it's

60
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:03,641
easier in the end.

61
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,727
Another one.

62
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:08,082
Fruits have natural sugar, which
is fine when eaten whole.

63
00:02:08,232 --> 00:02:11,482
But dried or canned fruits often
have extra sugar added.

64
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,397
Fresh fruit is the better choice.

65
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:14,483
There we go!

66
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,684
That's already a lot of information.

67
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:18,366
I think we are good for today.

68
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:21,349
If you already apply those tips,
you can go a long way.

69
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,012
In future lessons, We will find
how to replace those sugary foods,

70
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:25,825
don't worry.

71
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:28,977
I'm happy that you're taking the
good steps to remove sugar from

72
00:02:28,977 --> 00:02:29,697
your life.

73
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,291
I wish you a wonderful day, and
hope to see you in a future lesson!

74
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:33,291
I wish you a wonderful day, and
hope to see you in a future lesson!

75
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:34,377
See you soon!
