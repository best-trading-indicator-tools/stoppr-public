1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,435
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:03,375
I hope you're having a great
day.

3
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:05,390
I'm happy that you have come this
far!

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,172
You should be proud of yourself.

5
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:09,837
My name is Mark, and I'll be your
professor today.

6
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,341
This is lesson number two.

7
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,824
Today, we're talking about an
important sugar trap.

8
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:18,557
Sugar can sneak into our daily
lives without us noticing.

9
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:20,750
Knowing these traps can help
you avoid them.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,440
Let's discover trap number 1.

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,565
Trap of the day.

12
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,294
It's called "Just one bite".

13
00:00:25,944 --> 00:00:28,080
Do you know, when you tell yourself.

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,809
"Oh, I'll just take a little
bit".

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:30,849
Or also.

16
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,003
"It's so small it won't do anything".

17
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,646
"Look how small it is".

18
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:36,707
"It won't have any impact I'm
sure".

19
00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:37,422
Wrong.

20
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:38,733
Very wrong haha...

21
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:40,283
Sugar is just calling you.

22
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:43,777
It wants you to take a little
bit, so that you take more afterwards.

23
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,041
It's a real trap.

24
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,224
It's exactly like a drug.

25
00:00:47,374 --> 00:00:48,627
In fact, it is a drug.

26
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:51,246
Producers of sugary foods are
drug dealers.

27
00:00:51,496 --> 00:00:53,771
It's impossible to stop once you
start.

28
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,372
It's best to not take the first
bite.

29
00:00:56,522 --> 00:00:59,784
So that you don't take bite number
2, bite number 3, and then finish

30
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,609
the whole thing.

31
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:00,609
the whole thing.

32
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:03,181
Try to have something that can
replace sugar.

33
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:04,724
Something that you like!

34
00:01:04,874 --> 00:01:06,406
Like a Banana for instance.

35
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:10,035
Always try to have food that you
like around you, but that is also

36
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:10,604
healthy.

37
00:01:10,754 --> 00:01:13,749
So that you can always replace
that sugar bite, with something

38
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:14,330
better.

39
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,441
I'll give you a little homework
to do for next time.

40
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:18,566
Are you ready?

41
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:19,699
Go to your kitchen.

42
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:22,681
Pick up the most sugary thing
that you have, in that kitchen.

43
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,528
Look at it.

44
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:24,885
And then throw it away.

45
00:01:25,135 --> 00:01:26,343
Yes you heard me.

46
00:01:26,493 --> 00:01:28,025
Throw it away, in the trash.

47
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,365
Don't worry, this is not food
waste.

48
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:30,365
Don't worry, this is not food
waste.

49
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,908
Remember, sugar is a drug.

50
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:32,987
It's poison.

51
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:33,973
It's bad.

52
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:35,098
Bad for everyone.

53
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:36,084
Throw it away.

54
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:37,395
Don't pick it back.

55
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:39,410
You'll see that it will feel very
good.

56
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,953
It will feel like change.

57
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:42,589
Like you now have a super power.

58
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,892
Never be afraid to throw away
a sugary treat, that you have

59
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,158
bought out of panic.

60
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,841
You are not in panic anymore.

61
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:50,291
You can now throw it away.

62
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,184
It's ok.

63
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:52,727
Your body will thank you.

64
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:54,874
The YOU, from the future, will
thank you.

65
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:57,253
Remember these tips every day.

66
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,700
Understanding these sugar traps
helps you make better choices.

67
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,700
Understanding these sugar traps
helps you make better choices.

68
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,254
Now you're really in control of
sugar.

69
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:05,123
Sugar is not in control of you.

70
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:06,209
Feel good.

71
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,937
Enjoy having energy all day!

72
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,231
I'm happy of what we have accomplished
today.

73
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:12,106
I'll see you for the next lesson.

74
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:13,331
Have a great day.
