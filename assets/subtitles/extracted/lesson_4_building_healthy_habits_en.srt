1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,668
Welcome back!

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,636
You have been on quite the ride!

3
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,597
Not everyone gets this far.

4
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:07,976
Let's continue your learning
journey.

5
00:00:08,126 --> 00:00:10,077
And see what else, you can learn.

6
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,627
My name is Mary.

7
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:13,402
I'll be your teacher for today.

8
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,600
Today, in your Stoppr lesson,
we're focusing on a new trap.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,957
Trap number 2.

10
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:20,182
Skipping meals.

11
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:21,029
Yes.

12
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,572
It's not good to skip meals.

13
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:23,512
For real.

14
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,362
Let me explain all this, very
simply.

15
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:31,071
Skipping meals might seem harmless,
buuuuut, it's not good.

16
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:31,071
Skipping meals might seem harmless,
buuuuut, it's not good.

17
00:00:31,221 --> 00:00:33,635
It can lead to big sugar cravings.

18
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:35,086
Let me tell you why.

19
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,869
When you go too long without eating,
your body becomes very hungry.

20
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:44,350
To quickly get energy, your body
starts craving sugary snacks or

21
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,116
sweets.

22
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:46,799
Because it's a quick fix.

23
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,714
Your brain likes quick fixes.

24
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:51,186
The craving mechanism is turned
on.

25
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,297
These quick fixes are bad for
your body.

26
00:00:54,447 --> 00:00:58,162
This sugar give you a fast energy
boost, but it's very short.

27
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:00,030
It doesn't last long at all.

28
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:00,030
It doesn't last long at all.

29
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,578
30 minutes later, you're feeling
even more tired.

30
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,497
You're looking for more sugar
to do a new boost, and a new boost,

31
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:08,704
and a new boost.

32
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:10,765
And boom, you're in the cycle.

33
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:12,315
You're back in the drug.

34
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:14,044
They got you, haha.

35
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,552
Your body is like a small child.

36
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,535
You need to teach him that sugar
is not the way.

37
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:23,574
The more you'll use healthy food
for energy, the more sugar cravings

38
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:24,747
will disapear.

39
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:27,358
Teach your child body how to
behave.

40
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:29,923
Teach your child body what to
eat.

41
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:32,395
Teach your child body when to
eat.

42
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:35,553
Step by step you are creating
a routine.

43
00:01:35,703 --> 00:01:38,953
Eat healthy foods, at meal hours,
in normal quantity.

44
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:42,036
The more your repeat, the easier
it becomes.

45
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,323
The more your child body learns.

46
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,405
Don't skip a meal, don't eat sugary
snacks.

47
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:48,856
It's like clockwork.

48
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:53,146
At some point after 2 to 3 days,
it will become obvious for you.

49
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,882
You wont even think about it.

50
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,657
It will be very easy.

51
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:00,112
And your child body will just
do everything in auto pilot.

52
00:01:56,907 --> 00:02:00,112
And your child body will just
do everything in auto pilot.

53
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,148
And believe me, life in auto pilot
is easy.

54
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,598
It's joyful.

55
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,049
You won't want to go back.

56
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,685
That's what I want for you.

57
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:11,929
Easy days, easy weeks, in auto
pilot, without sugar cravings.

58
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:13,518
This is your future.

59
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,323
I want you to think of your day
as clockwork.

60
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:19,550
If your clock is ticking right,
you will never have to worry about

61
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,884
anything ever again.

62
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:24,060
Write your meal hours in your
calendar if that makes you feel

63
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,896
comfortable.

64
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,218
I hope you have a wonderful day.

65
00:02:27,468 --> 00:02:29,743
I will see you, in the next lesson.
