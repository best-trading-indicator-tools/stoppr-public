1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,685
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,539
Yes.

3
00:00:03,789 --> 00:00:05,229
We know each other already.

4
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:06,547
It's Mark again.

5
00:00:06,697 --> 00:00:08,369
And, I have another lesson for
you.

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,355
Are you ready?

7
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:13,041
It seems you have done a lot of
lessons, with many of my colleagues.

8
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,734
You're really motivated.

9
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:15,720
I like it!

10
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,850
Let's keep your learning going,
and see what else you can discover.

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,840
Today's Stoppr lesson is about
another sneaky trap.

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,151
Trap number 3.

13
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:24,422
Sugar at work.

14
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:26,198
Using sugar to boost your work.

15
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:27,509
To achieve a deadline.

16
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:29,988
Reaching for sugar when you're
tired at work.

17
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,159
We've all done it.

18
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:34,351
You're low on energy, a deadline
is coming, and that cookie or

19
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:36,000
chocolate bar is calling your
name.

20
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,968
Let's talk about why that's a
trap.

21
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:40,169
Sugar gives you fast energy, yes.

22
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:41,247
It hits quick.

23
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,605
But it doesn't last.

24
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,194
It's like lighting a match.

25
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,784
Bright for a second, then gone.

26
00:00:46,284 --> 00:00:47,956
Soon after, you're yawning again.

27
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,313
Your focus drops.

28
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:50,299
And guess what?

29
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:51,657
You want more sugar.

30
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:53,432
Another snack, another boost.

31
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:54,890
That's the sugar loop.

32
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,897
And once you're in, it's tough
to break out.

33
00:00:57,397 --> 00:00:59,023
It feels helpful at first.

34
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:02,052
A sweet snack, a sugary drink—it
gives you a little kick.

35
00:00:59,173 --> 00:01:02,052
A sweet snack, a sugary drink—it
gives you a little kick.

36
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:03,874
Like a small push forward.

37
00:01:04,124 --> 00:01:06,306
But here's the truth: that push
is fake.

38
00:01:06,456 --> 00:01:07,478
It doesn't last.

39
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:09,718
After the sugar rush, there's
always a crash.

40
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:10,711
Then what?

41
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:12,208
You struggle to focus.

42
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:13,658
You feel even more tired.

43
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,526
Work feels harder, not easier.

44
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,169
So you reach for more sugar.

45
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:17,970
Again.

46
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,863
And again.

47
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,195
It's not a snack anymore—it's
a pattern.

48
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:23,953
Over time, your brain links sugar
to focus.

49
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:26,611
It starts asking for it when
things get hard.

50
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,687
Not because you need it, but
because it's become your habit.

51
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:33,141
This relationship with sugar at
work becomes toxic.

52
00:01:29,937 --> 00:01:33,141
This relationship with sugar at
work becomes toxic.

53
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,891
It blurs the line between hunger
and stress.

54
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,342
Between fuel and escape.

55
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:40,878
It tricks you into thinking you're
solving a problem, when really,

56
00:01:40,878 --> 00:01:42,096
you're making it worse.

57
00:01:42,346 --> 00:01:43,415
And the worst part?

58
00:01:43,565 --> 00:01:44,911
It takes your power away.

59
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:48,359
Your energy, your focus—they're
no longer in your hands.

60
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,855
Sugar runs the show.

61
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:53,170
But naming this trap is the first
step to breaking it.

62
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:54,721
You've already done that.

63
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,085
And that's a big deal.

64
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:57,728
That will be all for today.

65
00:01:58,024 --> 00:01:59,325
I'll see you in the next lesson.

66
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,240
We'll keep working on your growth.

67
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,240
We'll keep working on your growth.
