1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,760
Hey hello you!

2
00:00:02,173 --> 00:00:03,264
You're still here.

3
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:04,761
That says something.

4
00:00:04,911 --> 00:00:06,676
You're curious, committed.

5
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:07,940
You want change.

6
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,391
And that matters.

7
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:12,520
I'm Alex, back with you for another
Stoppr lesson.

8
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,696
Today, we're looking at a different
kind of sugar trap.

9
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:17,053
Trap number 4.

10
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:19,254
Eating sugar to handle feelings.

11
00:00:19,504 --> 00:00:20,850
It's not about hunger.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,254
It's about comfort.

13
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,619
You're stressed.

14
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:24,698
You're sad.

15
00:00:24,848 --> 00:00:26,148
Maybe you're just bored.

16
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:27,598
And sugar's right there.

17
00:00:27,748 --> 00:00:28,491
Sweet.

18
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:29,291
Fast.

19
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:29,999
Easy.

20
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:32,292
It gives you that quick hit of
relief.

21
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:34,578
A second where everything feels
lighter.

22
00:00:34,728 --> 00:00:36,029
Like a small escape.

23
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,043
But that feeling fades fast.

24
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:39,308
And what's left?

25
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:40,301
Guilt.

26
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,240
Tiredness.

27
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,527
Maybe even more sadness than
before.

28
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:47,492
You didn't solve the feeling—you
just pushed it down for a moment.

29
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,342
Over time, sugar becomes your
shortcut.

30
00:00:50,492 --> 00:00:53,093
Not to happiness, but to avoiding
emotions.

31
00:00:53,243 --> 00:00:54,125
Hard day?

32
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:54,879
Snack.

33
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,679
Bad news?

34
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:56,294
Treat.

35
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:57,419
Feeling low?

36
00:00:57,569 --> 00:00:58,405
Chocolate.

37
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,652
And it's sneaky, because it works...

38
00:00:58,655 --> 00:01:00,652
And it's sneaky, because it works...

39
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:01,777
for a minute.

40
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,002
Then it doesn't.

41
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,017
The real problem is still there.

42
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,907
And now there's a new one: you're
stuck in a loop.

43
00:01:08,057 --> 00:01:11,308
Feeling something, eating sugar,
crashing, feeling worse.

44
00:01:11,558 --> 00:01:14,658
You start to fear your own feelings,
because you don't trust yourself

45
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,713
to handle them without food.

46
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:18,309
That's not fair to you.

47
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:19,945
You deserve more than that.

48
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:23,671
You deserve tools that actually
help, not tricks that wear off.

49
00:01:23,921 --> 00:01:25,454
This trap is powerful.

50
00:01:25,604 --> 00:01:27,043
But calling it what it is?

51
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:29,283
That's the start of breaking
free.

52
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,834
And you've just done that.

53
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,834
And you've just done that.

54
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,477
See you in the next lesson.

55
00:01:32,627 --> 00:01:33,695
You're doing great.
