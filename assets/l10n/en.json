  "fasting_info_title": "Why fasting?",
  "fasting_info_body": "Intermittent fasting is a structured pause from eating that can improve how your body handles glucose and hunger signals. By extending the time between meals, insulin levels fall, which supports fat burning and helps cells become more insulin‑sensitive.\n\nBlood sugar: Periods without food reduce post‑meal glucose spikes and allow insulin to return to baseline. Over time, studies show improved insulin sensitivity and lower fasting glucose in many people. More stable blood sugar often means steadier energy and fewer afternoon crashes.\n\nHunger hormones: Ghrelin (the 'I'm hungry' signal) tends to adapt with consistent fasting windows, which many people experience as fewer random cravings. Meanwhile, satiety hormones such as leptin can work more effectively when meals are timed consistently.\n\nMetabolic flexibility: Fasting encourages your body to switch between using glucose and stored fat for fuel. This flexibility is associated with better lipid profiles and easier weight management in some individuals.\n\nCellular housekeeping: Longer fasts can promote autophagy—your cells' natural clean‑up process—supporting cellular repair. This is an emerging area of research and should be approached gradually and sensibly.\n\nHow to start: Pick a realistic eating window (for example 12:12 or 14:10) and be consistent for 1–2 weeks. Hydrate well, prioritize protein and fiber at meals, and break your fast gently.\n\nSafety: Fasting isn't for everyone. Do not fast if you are pregnant, underweight, have a history of eating disorders, are on glucose‑lowering medications without medical supervision, or if your clinician has advised against it. Always listen to your body and consult a healthcare professional if unsure.",
