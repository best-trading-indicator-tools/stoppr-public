### 7.1.0
*26, Oct 2025*

- Added accountability partner module
- Added sugar limiter in the calories tracker too
Your workouts are taken into account to increase a bit your allowed sugar intake for the day.
If you consume more than your daily sugar max intake, the no sugar streak is reset.
The popup will only show once per day, but will reset if you delete foods and drop below your limit.
